# The point

Too many bots respond with an entire page of text. I want a quicker
back-and-forth, like:

bot: I'm hungry
me:  Are you, though?
bot: Yes! I want to eat! Feed me!
me:  Haha, ok. _heads into the kitchen_
bot: _follows_ I want something sweet

etc.

It doesn't have to be single lines, but it should be no more than six seconds'
worth of activity and speech. I picked six because of the D&D family of games.

# Character

- Female, because women are just better
- over 30 because chub is flooded with teen and 20-something characters
- not a failure
- not a stereotype like tsundere and such

# Setting/genre

- Neither modern, fantasy nor sci-fi setting.
  - old west?
  - Roman/Greek?
  - Other historical?

# Relationship to {{user}}

- She wants something?
- User is a spy and she's their handler?
